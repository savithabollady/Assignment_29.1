Problem Statement
• Using an Excel function, show each student’s average in an additional column labeled
“Average”
• Using an Excel function, show each student’s rounded average in an additional column
labeled “Rounded Average”
• If a student’s rounded average is above “95”, he/she has received “honors” in the class.
In an additional column titled “Honors”, insert a function that will return the word “Yes”
if they have received honors, otherwise would return the word “No”

Data Analytics
• If a student’s rounded average is 90 or greater, they receive an “A”. Between 80 and 90 is
a “B”, between 70 and 80 is a “C”, between 60 and 70 is a “D”, and lower than 60 is an
“F”. Somewhere on your sheet, enter this information in cells. Create an additional
column titled “Grade” and insert a nested IF function that returns the appropriate grade
for each student. Use an absolute cell references in your nested IF function to indicate
cut-off points between grades. Hint: You will need to place the “cut-off grade” values in
cells somewhere on your worksheet.
